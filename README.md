# Rock-Paper-Scissors
My first attempt at creating Rock Paper Scissors.  
Almost no design, as I did it mostly to test my JS knowledge.  
Puts event listener on parent div of image inputs, then stores it inside a localStorage.  
Has an input asking for username.  
Choices and username are displayed in their own paragraphs.  
Decided to use Comic Sans because it looks better with my intentionally non-perfect images.
